Welcome to Save the Platypus!

This is a 2D game made using Java v 21.0.2 and JavaFX. 

## How the games works 

The objective of this game is to try to make your platypus 
survive as many cycles of enemy attacks as possible. Enemies are shot across the screen both vertically and horizontally. To 
survive, use the arrows keys, UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT to dodge these attacks. If your platypus touches the enemies, it is GAME OVER.
